indeed, had hc relicd wholly on his own resonrocs; but his
habit was to choose a work of some Greek philosopher, and
to translate it or give the substance in his own words, adding
any illustratione that occurred to him from Roman life.¹

8. His reading, no doubt very extensive, had shown him
the great divergcnce of opinion among philosophers upon all
the subjecte that came nndcr their consideration3’ and this
fact alone sufficed to convince him that it was impossible to

knowledgmcnt that anything lilre absolute certainty was nn-

probable. Although certainty was impossible, he held that

investigation might lead to a high degree of probability, ’

enough for all the practical purposes of life.⁴ Ile held hirn-
self therefore at liberty to choose from any system a doctrine
which soemcd to have the balance of probability in its favor,
and to change this at any time for another which then ap-
