thing is done in harmony with the individual reason according
to the will of tho governor of all things.¹

15. This is the absolute good3 and as a matter of theory the
Stoice did not admit any other. Chrysippus says (Plut dc
Stolc. Rep. 5, 2) ἕν τῷ κατ’ ἀρετὴν βιοῦν μόνον dori τὸ sidoc-
μόνως, τῶν ἄλλων οὐδὲν ὄντων πρός ἡμᾶς οὐδ’ εἷς τοῦτο συνερ-
γοόντων. All other things, however important they may be
to our life, such ns health, riches, honor, and even life itself,
are not yood, any more than their opposites, siolrness, poverty,
disgraeo, or death, are cril; they are ἀδιάφορα. It was not de·
nied that there was a certain difference in these things, sorno
being good in themselves, and others good as a means of at
taining the good3 but, strictly speaking, nothing was good,
which, lilre riches, might under any circumstances tend to evil;

’ only that was good which was unconditionally so, the differ·

enee between good and evil being one of nature, not of degree*
Furthcr, n the good is defined, as Socrates defined it, to be
the ιιεςΐιιὶ, then virtue alone is uaeful, utility is identioal with
right. Stoh.11.188 ε1ναι γὰρ τό ὠφελεῖν ἴσχειν κατ’ όρετὴν
καὶ τό ὡφελεῖσθαι κινεῖσθαι κατ’ ἀρετήν. So thet in the end
happiness is identioal with virtue, the good and the nseful
with conduct conformable to reason, and there ia no good bnt
virtue. ·

16. The St'oies especially insistcd that plausere wasnota
good, or, as Epicurus held, the highest end of liie3 to allow this
was in their view to deny the very essence of good. Although
a sort of pleasure, rather χαρό,ροιιι1ι“ιιιιι,11ιιιο ἡδονὴ, laetitia,
voluptas, does undoubtedly accompany the practice of vir·
tue, yet this was not an aim, constituent part, or condition of
moral action, but only a natural consequonee; Diog. Laert.
