’111191 ἐπιγεννήματα δὲ τήν τι χαρὰν καὶ τὴν ιῖιφροοῦνην sul
τὰ παραπλήσια. Virtne is all-sufficient for happiness, it is its
“ own reward3 and it is called in this respect τέχνη εὐδαιμονίας
ποιητική (Alex. Aphr. dc An. 156, b, 0), and so complete is
this οὒταρκίο ef virtue, that the happiness cannot be increased
by time, the virtnons man is completely happy and indepen-
dcnt of all outward things.

172 But man is not only endowed with reason, he has et
the samo time certain passione repugnant to reason; and
as virtue is conformity to, so vice is the contradiction of,
right reason. Pession is such a condition of the ἡγεμονικόν,
or reason, that the reason is violently impelled to something
contrary te itseli3¹ it is an intercal change, not a condition
sirperinduced irem without3 it is an error of jndgment3 vir·
tuo is wisdom, viee is ignorance.¹ And the passione are in
our own power; they are, moreever, disturbancos of the health,
and may become actual diseases, of the sonl; real virtue can,
exist only when they are completely suppressed.³

18. Virtus, then, negatively considered, is ireedom from the
passions,cine'10na: positively it is subjection to thc general
law of natnro,and a government oi onc’s seli according to·
reason, Hence it is entirely a matter oi reason, and may be
called'simply rightly regulated reason (Tusc. Disp. IV. 15, 34
spec virtus brevissime recle ratio dici polest). Moreover, it
contains two clemente, one theoretica! and another practical.
The root and condition ot all virtuons-action is right knowl-
edge3 virtue is knowledge, vice is ignorancc (Diog. Laert. VIL ·

· 93 εἶναι δ’ ἀγνοίας τὰς κακίας, ὧν αἱ ἀρεταὶ ε’πιοτῆμαι); but

virtue is also health and strength, the right and hennonious
constitution of the soul. It is, in fine, ench annion oi the prac-
tical with the theoretioal that action is based upon knowledge,
