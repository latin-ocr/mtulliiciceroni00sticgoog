of common life. Althongh, as matter of theory, virtue was
the only good, it could not be denied that many things were

’ either necessary or helplul to the common man; hence these

could not all be ἀδιάφορα, or indifferent Then all those things
which satisly the instinct of aelf-preservation, the πρῶτα κατὰ
φύσιν, must have a value, and that testing upon the eonstitu-
tion ol human nature3¹ this was in fact the first step in the
reasoning which led ιο the idea el the semmam bonam.
Moreover, if all these external things were ἀδιάφορα, no roem
would be left for a reasonable choica, noue for the exereise of
wisdom3 in fine, no motive for aetion.¹

14. A further division was then made of the ἀδιάφορα into
three classes.¹ 'l'he first contained things which, although
absolutely neither good nor evil, have yet a relative worth,
either as being adapted ιο human nature, or as being helplul
ιο the moral Πίος these arethe προηγμένα, the preferable or

desirable things. The second class, the ἀποπροηγμένα, are the
· reverse, things that are to be rejected, undesirable. Between

these is the third class, the ἀδιάφορα in a restricted sense,
things which are either absolutely indifferent, or ol so vague a
character as to excite neither desire nor aversion- Examples
of προηγμένα are mental endovvments, good natural disposi-
tion, special aptitudes, beauty, strength, health, life itself, riches,
honor, noble descent, ete.; the oppositas are ἀποπροηγμένα.
Instances of the ἀδιάφορα are, whether the number ol the
hairs of ene’s head are odd or even; whether I use one ploce
ol money or another ιο paya debt.

25. The Stolos endeavored to maintaiu all these distinctions
in practiee; bnt this was almost impossible, and the authorities ·
differ very much in the terma they employ. Even Chrysippus
is said ιο have declared it absurd not ιο desire health and
riches, and ιο have permitted the statesman ιο regard tichos
and honor as essentially good.⁴
