INTRODUOTION. xvii

26. These concessione lod naturally to smodificetiou of the

idea oi duty. The κατόρθωμα uas explained above to be nn
nction good in itsclf and procecding from a right intention,
containing all the clemente oi right. The objcct of such nu
action is the absolute good; and if this alone were admitted
to be the object oi our actions, there could be but one duty.
But when that which is relatively good is admitted to be
morully dcsirnblc, the idea aud sphere of duty ere enlnrged.
Dutics,¹ τὰ καθήκοντα, from this point of view, are dividcd
into complete duties, binding under all circumstances, κατορθὼ·
ματα, καθήκοντα τέλεια, τὰ κἰεὶ καθήκοντα, perfectum officium,
ebc.; and middle duties, μέσα καθήκοντα, τὰ μή tiri καθήκοντα,
officia media, which are concerued with the τροήγμένα,οαθ
vary according to circumstances¹

tius und his followers, returned to the populor usage, und, using καθῆκον
in the general und populor sense, dirided it into τὸ ἀεὶ καθῆκον (identicnl .
with rb κατόρθωμα), und τὸ οὐκ ἀεὶ καθῆκον. The proper interpretation
. ot the 'delinition in D. L. VII. 107 is in question: καθῆκον φασὶν sivest
