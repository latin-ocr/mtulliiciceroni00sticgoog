virtues the Aristotelian division of duties into dianoetie and
practical. His famous worlr, ssepi καθήκοντος, was a practical
treatise, 'intended not for the ideal suge, bnt ior the common
man of the world.

30. His book was divided, as Cicero tells us (1. ἓ 9), into
three parts; the first treated of duties derived from the idea
of right ;Ἰ the second those from the idea oi expedieney3 and
the third, which for some reason he failed to write, would
have disenssed the cases of eoufliet'betweeu the two classes. ’

31. Cieerc criticises this division in Ι. g 9 as being iucom-
plete, and proposes instead another into five parts3 the duties
flowing from the honestam ; the question which oi two honesta
is to be preferred; the utile ,· the question which of two atilio
is to be preferred3 and, lastly, the confliet between the tonea-
tum and the utile. ,

33. The first part occupies the greater portion of the first
book, as far as c. 43, and is based on the work oi Panaetius.
The second part, oecupying only the remaining three chap-
ters,was, if we may judge from c. 45 und from Ep. ad Att.
XVI. 11, 4, based ou a work of Posidonius. Panaetius is
again the model for the third part, which is treated in tho
meond book, as far as ξ 86. For the brief remaining portion,
containing all that is said on the fourth head, a work oi An·
tipat'er ol'l'yre,1nent'ioned in § 86, seems to have been tho
foundation.
¹ Ἰ33. For the fifth part, which occupies the whole third book,
(lieero claims to have relied on himself. lt is, however, prob·
able that he used to some extent the work of Posidonius (see
ξ 88)‘; and a book of Hecate, a pupil of Panaetius, was still
more useful, unless perhaps his knowledge oi it was gethered
from the snmmary (τὰ κεφάλαια), mentioued iu the letter to
Atticus.¹ ' ’

34. We see, then, that iu the Dc Finibus, where the discus·
sion is theoretical, the author is undecidcd in his views, but'
rather opposed to the Stoics; in the present work he adopts
