xx INTRODUOTION.

the Stoie classifieathn, and uses it as aframeworlr for his own
thoughts, although there is little in the development of ideas
to condiet with the Peripatetie teaehings. He occasionally
refers to the similarity of his own views to the latter, as'for
instance in I. 1, 2. It is of course not possible to say how
closely he followed Panaetius in the first two boolrs3 it is
natural to suppose that tho examples from Roman history
were his own3 and so doubtless were many of the reflectione
suggested by them. In the general tone there is very little
in tho whole work that would be foreign to modern ideas.
The author holds the existence of an innato moral sense (Tusa.
Disp.111.1,a runt enim ingeratis ruostris semina innota cirtu-
tum; quus si adolescere liceret, ipsu nos od beatem uitem rre-
turo perduceret); the good is an inherent quality of actions3
and this is never changed by any consideration of expedienoy.
No assertion occurs oftenor with him than that nothing is en-
pedient which is not also good (nihil, praeter r'd quod hones·
tum sit, propter se ease eepctmdem). Tho honestum is what
it is by nature, it is not a mutter of opinion3 De Leg. I. 16,
44 ccc solum ius ct iniuria nature diiudicatur, aed omnino
omnio lrmccatu et turpie; and so 17, 46.

35. The Dc Officiis has always been one of the most pop·
ulan of Cicero's worhs. Pliny (H. N. Praef.§ 22) speaks of
the books as volumina ediscenda, nou modo in menibus coti-
die habenda. St. Ambrose composed a work with the same ti·
tle, following very nearly the same plan. Melanchthon sancte
a commentary on Cicero’s boolr, and says reon alius astat
libellus cle moribus obsoletior officiis Ciceronis. Erasmus did
not doubt quiaillud metus, unde ista prodierunt, aliqua di·
viuitas occuparit. Frederiek tho Great pronounced it “the
best work on morals that has been or can be written.’'

36. Later crities are not so indulgent. Prot. Mommsen,
for instance (Rom. Gesch. 111r, 607), considers Cicero’s
“philosophical library‚'’ scribbled off in n eonple ol months,

aeomplete failure3 and if tho worlrs are jndged as scientific
treatises, there is a great deal of justice in the criticism. The
tmth lies perhaps between the two extremes3 auditis hardly
