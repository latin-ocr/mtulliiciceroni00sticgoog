has a wider scope than any other. It may be treated under
two heads—justice and liberality.

01 justice, in this narrower sense, the first duty is never to
do a wrong 10 any one unless we have sufficient provocation;
the second, to use things which belong to all persons in corn·
mon, as well as one's own property, without violating tbe rights
01 others We should try to draw closer the honds of human
society (22) by 011 interchange of good offices3 and good 101111,
01 steadfastncss and 1111111 in all our sayings and dealings, is
the foundation oi justice.

Oi injustice (23) there are two kinds3 the first, where aper·
son inflicts awrong 011 011011101; the second, where he neglecte
to prevent a wrong being done to another.

· The most common motive for inflicting injuries (24) 10 the
desire of obtaining undue 'power 01 riches. The most am-
bitious men desire wealth (VIII. 25) 11 order 10 gain influence
in the state, aud to be able to distribute largesses, as was tho
case with Crassus3 some care much 101 0 brilliant style 01111-

to others. But meu 01101101 forget justice (26) when they arc
carried away by the thirst 101 110101, power, and glory, as Ο.
Caesar was. A premeditated wrong (27) is more blameworthy
111011 0110 committed under the impulse 01 passion.

There are several causes 01 neglect to prevent injustice to
others (IX. 28); reluctance to incur labor aad expense, neg-
ligenoe, sloth, or devotion to onc's own occupations. Tho
philosophers, perhaps, fall into this 01101. “

11 is much easier to judge rightly in regard to the duties
01 other persons (29) 111011111 regard to our own; heuoe it is
well (30) never to do anything as to the rightfulness 01 which
we have any doubt. ’

But cases 011011 occur when duty varies (X. 31) according
10 circumstances ς in these we must aim to act in such a way

. that injury shall ba done to no one, and consult the common

good.¹ Sometimes the execution 01 0 promise is inexpedient
(32) 10 0110 01 the other 01 the parties. Promises are not to
be kept when the lulfilnrent would work 0 greater injury to
