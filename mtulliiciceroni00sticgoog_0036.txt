¹attracta attention (87); the former is tha essenos of tha virtue.

'ruis is seen in two things: 0 persuasion that nothing is right
which is not good3 and a perfect tranquillity of mind. The
excessivo desires (68) of pleasnre, money, sod glory are evil.
Δ quiet mind should be our aim (69); for this philosophans
and serious men often retire from publio 111οζ They may¹ per-
haps be excused; their life is easier (ΧΧῙ. 70), though less
useful and glorious than a public one. Especially are they
excusable (71) 11 they rctire for study or any serious reason3
but false pride and despondency aro evil. If one is fitted by
nature (7 8), he should engage in public lile, without, however,
giving up his independence (7 8) ; and before undertaking any-
thing bc sure 01 the means to accomplish it.

Tho common idea that military glory (XXIL 71) 10 much
greater than that gained in civil life is not always correct
Solon (75) did as rnuch for his country as Themistocles; wc
may cite too the examples of Pausanias (76) and Lysander,
Scaurus, Marius, and other cases in Roman life; and Cicero’s
own success (77, 78) in quelling the insurrection oi Catilina.

Although the body should be trained to endurance (XXIII.
79),11 10 the mind that is required here; and hence civilians
often accomplish more in aar than those who actually carry
iton.

A bravo and stcadfast man (80) should novor lose his
presence of mind, and never be surpriscd (81) by an unione·
seon difficulty.

, A great man treats aconquered enemy (XXIV. 88) justly,
punishing only the guilty. Timidity must be shunned on the
one hand (83), rashness on the other. We should be more
ready to expose ourselvcs than the state to danger, and even
sacrifice our own fame to the public good. Many: hanc been
williug to give up everything (84) for their country but their
own glory, like Callicratidas and Cleombrotus3 it was not so
with Q. Maximus.

Those who arc iu public office (XXV. 85) must talne care,
first, that they serve the public interest rather than their υνυς
secondly, that they sorve tho whole state, not a mere party.
