Β11 we must slwsys keep in mind (XXX. 10⁵) the dil· '
11111111 between the nature 11 nisu and that 11 the lower r

animnls3 the latter are governed by appetite, the former hy

reason. Pisaurense) shouldbo moderate, and sober living

11 better than luxury.

We may also observa in 1111111111 two characters (lot): l

one common to 11 with our follow-men, distinguishing ns from

the brute creation3 the other peculias to ns as individuale 2

There are the same differencos in our minds asin our bodies3
and this may be illustrated (108, 101) by many examples

So 111 as we do not set against nature in the geneml sense
(XXXI. 110), we may follow our own individual 11111111111;
in fact, unless we do so (111), nothing can be really fitting.
So trne is this that thero 111 some situations in life in which
suicide (112) 11 1 duty 111 111 man, but would bc blame·
worthy in another. Cato and his associatos illustrate this dil-
ference. Ulysses and Aiax (113) 111 examples of opposite
characters. Eaeh person, therefore (114), should choose the
eourso of life most consonant with his natural gista, as the
enters choose their parts in a play.

Besides these two characters there is a third (XXXII. 111)
uhieh chance or circumstances impose upon us3 and 1 fourth,
the result 111111 own 1111111. Our station in 1111 111 matter
11 chanee; the manner iu which we 1111 11 depende upon our
111111. We choose 1 profession, either (111) that of our
11111111 11 1111111111, 11 1 different one, often at an age (111)
when we are least eornpetent to do so; for not 111 11111111
make the deliberate choise 11 Η1111111 (118).

It sometimes happens that men of great genius or acquire
ments (XXXIII. 119) 111 able themselves 1ο select 11111111-
1111; in this 1111 natural gifts, rather than 11111111 circnm-
stances, should determine their ehoiee. When this is oneo
fixed, it should be persevered in; but if a change is necessary
(120), 11 should be thoughtfnlly made. In imitating our an-
cestors (121) 11 course their 111111 are to be· avoided; we may
11 least emulate their virtues.

Duties differ also (XXXIV. 122) 111 the old and the young.
