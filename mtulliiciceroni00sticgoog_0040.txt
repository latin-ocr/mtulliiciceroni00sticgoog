There are many occupations iu which nu honorable man
may not engage. Such are those which are distustefnl 1ο
other perseus, those of money-lenden, hirelings, retail dealem,
artisans, ete.; where considerable skill is required, a calling
may be respectable for those ol a corresponding position;
commerce, ii conducted on a large scale, is not to be dispar.
sged3 but agriculture is of all pursuits the most worthy ota
free man (150, 151).

XLIII. 152. Comparison of two honeste. Oascs some-
tImes arise in which we have 1ο decide which of two right
actious is 1ο be preferred. The general rule (153) is that
duties which concern the interests ot society take precedenee
ο1 those relating 1ο mere knowledge. For knowledge itself,
in its most general sense, hes to do with the followship of gods
and meu; and if this is the highest knowledge, the duties
urising from it must also be the highest But this knowledge
is useless unless 11 be employed iu action, aud especially in the
service of others; and this is shown by the conduct of the
best men. Every one would luy aside other dnties in ease
ol danger to his country (154), his relations, or friends. So
the greatest studente heve never withdrawn themselves from
these responsihilities (XLIV. 155); linet iu person, they have
scrved others by their books. And eloquence (156) is'better
thau study alone. Meu are bom social beings (151)“; hence
knowledge, spart from this association, is empty, nnd fortitude
may become brutality. It is not true, as some say (158), that
human society took its origin from the need of mutual aid iu
supplying men’s wants3 for, even if all these were supplied by
magle, man would shriuk from solitudo.

These duties arc not always, however, to take precedenee of
that of temporanee (XLV. 159) ; for some actions are so base
as not to be allowable on any consideration. As 1ο the order
ο1 common dnties (160) we should arrange them thus: first,
those to the gods; second, those 1ο our country; third, those
1ο relations, and next, the others in order.
