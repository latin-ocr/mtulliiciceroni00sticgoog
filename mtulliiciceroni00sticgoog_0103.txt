BOOK 11.

SUMMARY.

Ι. 1-ΙΙ. 8. 'In the introduction Cicero meets the criticisms
of those who had blamed his retirement from publio life, and
explains (7) the apparent inconsistenoy of professing Academia
or soeptioal opinions and, at tho same 111110, laying down posi

The second hook proper treats of duties under the second
general head of Panaetius, that of expediency (utile); or, ac-

to man (11) are either inanimato or animate: of animate hoinga
some aro ondowed with reason, others are not so; those en-
dowod with reason, again, are either gods or mon. It is this
last class that may be useful or harmlul to us. But the gods
aro appeasod by piety and sauotity, and cannot he supposed to
wish to injure us3 next to them (la-15) it is to our lellow-m'en
that wo look for aid in our pursuit ες and we are dependent
on their services even in order to avail oursolves of the forces
and object s t'of rnanrma e nature. From them corne likewise

Henoe (11) the arm of rig 01111101 ion is to oouoiliate men and
