at first good men, exalted ιο power in order to secum justice;
and lawa were first made with the same design (42). True
glory is based on real worth (43); Socrates used te say, that
ιο obtain it most quiehly one should really be that which he
wished to be considered.

A few practical directions (XIII. 44), may be given for this
purpose. These born to high station hare already a certain
distinctiou3 others (45) should cherish high airus, and espe-
cially strive for military glory. The first recommendatiou ina
young man (46) is modesty towards parents, hindly feeling¹
towards his equals; it is well ιο cultivate the society oi dis·
tingnished men.

Although eloquence (xlv. 48) contribules much ιο glory,
a genial manner in conversation is siugularly effective. Elo-

guilty.

We next consider the duty oi liberalius (XV. 52), which
is shown in two ways: by persensi exertion or by gifts
of money. Oi these the latter is easier, the former more
. dignified. The latter exhausts the fountain of eharity;
with the former, by the act of giving we are made mere
able to give (53). If money is given (54), it should be
done carefully and in mederation; if the resources of the
giver are exhaust-ed, he is led into wrongdoing to replenish
them. There is a difference (XVI. 55) between lavishness,
which is ιο ιο blamed, and liberality (56). Public gemes
have been always expected from the aediles, in which, of
course, any appearance oi stinginess is ιο ιο avoided, but
each one must consult his own ability (XVII. 58). Modera·
tion (59) is the best rnle. Money given lor this purpose is
well expended in public works ef permanent velue (60).

ln' the matter of liberality (XVIII. 61) we should be gov-
erned by circumstances, being mere ready to aid the suffering
