ality vell bestowed (63) brings general popularity; anderen
in the ordinary transactione of life (64) ἱι is better not' to be

foreigners, is rightly praised. ⁴

We may do good by pomonal exertion (XIX. 65), ιο the
atate or ιο individuale One may often gaiu much inlinence
aad popularity by riding others rvith advice; aud for thia
reason the study of law was formerly held in great honor.
When this is beyond our parrer, rre can give our eloquenoe ·

In helping others (XX. 69, 70) ἰι is generally recognized
that we ought ιο consider the character rather than the posi·
