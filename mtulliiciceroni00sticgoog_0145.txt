BOOK III.

SUMMARY.

· 11-11.o. In the introduction Cicero speaks of his en-
forced retirement from public life, comparing his own lot with
that oi Scipio Africanum and again exhorta bis son (5) to
profit as much as possible by his opportunities of study at
Athens.

Panaetius, he says (7), dirided tbe subject of practical mo·
rality into three heads, considering under the first the question
whether an aetion was right3 under tlrc second, whether an
aetion was expedient3 under the third, the conflict between
the two. He discussed the first two points in the three pub
lished boolrs, bnt ¹left his work nnfinisbed. Many persons
think that the omission was intentional, because, from tbe
nature of the casea conflict between what is right and what
is expedientis impossible. ’

That Panaetius intended to discuss this point (III. 11) cau-
not be doubted, but whether he was justified in admitting
the existence of such aquestiou is a matter on which opinions ,
may differ. Whether, with the Stoice, we hold that virtue is
the only good, or, with the Peripatetico, that nothing else is
of any weight in comparison with virtue, in neither case can
there be any confliot between right and expediency3 and, as
Panaetius held the Stolo view (12), it would seem that he
could not have admitted the possibility of such a confliet.
But a completely virtnous aetion (13) can be performed only
by the sapiens ; other men attain only the semblanee of such
conduct3 and the duties of which wo arc treating (14) are
the medio officia, such as are performed by ordinary nien.
