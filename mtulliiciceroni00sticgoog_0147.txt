Stoic- or the Peripatetic doctrine, while we attempt with our
own resourccs the discussion of the point which was omitted
by Panaetius.

When we have occasion to consider an aetion that is up
porently expedient (VIII. 35), we rnust rernember that, if it
is wrong, it is not really expedient. From neglect oi this-pre·
cantion (36) eome'all sorts of crimes3 and not eve'n a doubt
(37) should be admitted. Nor should the possibility oi es-
caping detection tempt ns to urong3 not even if we had the
ring ci Gyges (Ile 38).

The question often arises (X 40) whether an action which
seems 'expedient can be rightfully performed. Brutus was
justified iu excluding Collatinus from the consular power3 but
Romulus (41) did wrong to kill his brother Remus. We may
nse every effert to further our own interests (42), if at the
same time wedene wrong to others.

Doubts more often arise in regard to duty when our friend-
ships are involved (43). We should never neglect the dutics
of friendship for the sake of honor, riches, or pleasure3 on the
other hand, devotion to a friend must never lead us so far as
t'o violateour duty to the state, to break an cath or a promise.
· In public affairs expediency (XI) often leads to wrongdoing,
as when wc destroyed Corinth3 but cruelty‚ such as that of
the Atheniens towards the people oi Aegina, is never expe-
dient. Itis especially praiseworthy if a nation disregards ex-
pedieney for the sake of right, as our own people did after the
battle of Cannae3 aud the Atheniens (48), when they deeided
to meet Xerxes with their fleet3 and again, when they refused
to burn the Spartan fleet (49), as Themistocles advised.

Iu many cases (xit 50) we have to consider whether what
is expedient is completely inconsistent with right, or may be
reconciled with· it. For instance, during a famine at Rhodes
a merchant arrives with a cargo oi grain from Alexandriaand
knows that others are coming directly afterhim3 coemitur,
whether he is bound to disclose that fact, oi· may sell at the
current price. Allllpsslssl'iffl) holds that he is'¹ bound to dis-

elose it; Diogenes says that, so long as he acts within ene?
