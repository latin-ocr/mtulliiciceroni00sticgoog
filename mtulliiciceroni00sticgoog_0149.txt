that we even followed thisl' Itis often difficolt (70), and
it even requires au able jndge, to decide between conflicting
claims. One of the greatest dangers (72) is when dishonesty
assumes the mask of wisdem.

A few difficolt cases may be cited (XVIII. 78) by way of
example. A will was. forged‚ purporting te have been made
by Basilus, in which Crassus and Hortensius were named as
co-heirs3 and yet they accepted the pretended legaey. They
acted wrougly3 for it is not enough not to be the principal in
a wroug; oue must not be an accessory. An upright man
(ΧΙΧ) will never do anything which would violate the rights
of others; he will never be a will-huntcr. ,We ought to
avoid the thought eren (77) oi what we should not dare to
speak..

The greater the advantage to ,be gained (XX. 79), 888 greater
is the temptation to wrong. Marius was serviug in the army
of Metellus, and, when sent by him with a message 88 Reme,
he intrigned against and supplanted his commender. Grati-
dianus madc a premature announcement (80) 88 888 people
of a law on the coinage, and so took the credit to himself
over hia oolleagucs. Sometimes the advantage to be gained
(81) seems immeasurably greater than the wrong done to gain
it, as in the ease of Marius just mentioned; 888 88 advantage
can compensate (82) the loss of one's reputation for houesty.

This it was that induced Pompey to marry the daughter of
Caesar (XXI). Caesar thought anything right ii done for the
sake oi power. This is a fatal error3 if a man really thinks
thus, it is useless to argue with him. But power nujustly
obtained brings so mueh. suffering (84) that it can hardly 88
desirablc. How could life be desirablc 8ο a man (85) whose
mordereris now considered a public benefactorl

Fabricius and 888 senate shewed their opinion on this sub·
ject by sending back the desertor from Pyrrhus (XXII. 86);
888 the senate did wrong (87) 88 make those states tributary
that had once bought from Sulla their exemption3 and Cato,
in nry opinion, treet-ed the publicans and the socii with far too
great severity.
