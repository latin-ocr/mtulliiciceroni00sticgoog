Hecate (XXIII. 89), in the sixth book “De Officiis,” pro·
posen and answcrs many questions of casuistry (89-99).

Among others (XXIV. 99) he aska whether bargaius aud
promises made ιιι good faith arealways ιο be kept. It would
seem that there are exceptious.

Promises are not to be hept (XXV. 94) when the fullil·
ment would be inexpedient for the person to whom they are
ruade; as, for instance, the promise made to Phaethon mt tels
fablc, and that made ιο Theseus in regard ιο . Hippolytus.
Agnin, it would have been better for Agamemnon (9.5) not to
sacrifico Iphigenia. Thus we see that circumstances some
times change the character of the aetion.

Oi the four heads under which we treated of duty' ιιι the
first book (96) we have duelt sufficiently ou tho first two; it
now remains ιο speak of the third and fourth.

It seemedexpedieut ιο Ulysses (XXVI. 97) ιο avoid going

itself a greater wrong. Again, thc promise was made to an
enemy3 aud sometimes what is in a high degree expedient
thereby becomes right.”

But (XXIX. 104) whatever a man promises, calling (lod ιο
witness, is ιο be maintained, because itis just and right ιο do
so. Secondly, hodily tortura is not so great an cvil as wrong·
doing. Thirdly (106),ο promise, made even ιο a recognized
enemy, must be kept according to the tenor of the language·

This is shown by several examples (XXX. 199) from our
history. And that Regulus (110) himself advocated iu the
senate the retaining oi the captives is thc most admirable pari
ol his conduct. His returuing to Carthage (XXXI. 111) was
