BOOK 111. 121

in consonance with the customs of the time, as is scen from the
Twelve Tables, the laws, and the action of the censore. N otc,
also, the example of T. Manlius (112). Hannibal sent tho
captives (XXXII. 113) to treat for au exchange after the batÎ‡
tle ot Cannae3 they would bave done wrongly not to obey
their oath to roturn3 one oi thom, who attempted to evade
the ooth, was rightly sent back hy thc senate.

The fourth point of the discussion still remains (XXXIII.
116), the conflict of expediency with the duty of temperancc3
and here we have to contend with those philosophans, such as
the Cyrenaico and Epicurus, who consider pleasure the highest
good. But if plcasure is the great end of life, what placo is
left (111) for prodeam, or fortitude, or temperancet Epi-
curus (118) succeeds, it is truc, to some extent in finding a
sphere for these virtues3 but not so for justice. But (119)
as wc have shown that there is no such thing as an expedicncy
which is contrary to right, so we declaro that all ploasure is
contrary to right3 and the attempt to unite thom is futile.

Pleasu-re (120) may add a charm to the right, but never can
bc really expedient.
