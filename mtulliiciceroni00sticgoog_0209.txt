Aristonis: Aristo 01 Chios, a disciple of Zeno, differed very
much from his teacher. He considered ethice the only impor-
tant part of philosophy, and limited very considerably its do-
main. He held that the root of all the virtues was healtb, or,
according to Galen, tho knowledge of good and evil, meaning
probably a sound moral judgment3 but by denying all differ·
enses between the ἀδιάφορα, and contending that nothing was
01 any salus but absolute good, 110 leit no room for practical
morality, or, as Cicero says, uo dilectum rerum. Plut. Virt. Mor.

mpura-Pyrrhonis: Pyrrho, a native 01 Elis, was contemporary
with Alexander the Grcat. He was a eceptio, and held that we
can know nothing 01 the constitution 01 things, that, therefore,
we can form no trustworthy opinions about them, and thet the
result 01 this mental attitude will always be that tranquil-
lity, ἀταραξία, which 100010 10 happiness Right and wrong are
therefore, according 10 him, matters 01 law and custom. Diog.
Laert. IX. 61 οὐδὲν γὰρ ἔφασκεν οὔτε καλὸν οὔτε αἰσχρὸν οὔτε δίκαιον
οὔτε ἄδικον, καὶ ὁμοίως ἐπὶ πάντων, μηδὲν εἶναι τῇ ἀληθείᾳ, νόμῳ δὲ
καί ἔθει πάντο τοὺς ἀνθρώπους πράττειν, οὗ γὰρ μᾶλλον τόδε ἢ τόδε
εἶναι ἕκαστον. Ι80111. Emp. Math. XI. 140 οὔτε ἀγαθόν τι ἔστι φύσει
οὔτε κακόν, ἀλλὰ πρὸς ἀνθρώπων τοῦτο νόῳ κέκριται κατὰ τὸν Τίμωνα.
—Erllllz Erillus 01 Carthage, also a pupil 01 Zeno, taught that
knowledge was the highest good, scientium summum bonum esse
000 rem 011001 aliam per re aspiciendam (Dc Fin. V. 25, ’13); aud
Diog. Laert. VII. 1653 but 110 taught also that among the ἀδιά-
φορα many things were desirable which 110 termed ὑποτελίδεο,
and these seem to have been substautially the sume as the προηγ-
μένα 01 tbe other Stoics3 so that his divergence from pure Stoi·
cism was not very great. He held διαφέρειν τέλος καὶ ὑποτελίδα. ’
τῆς μὲν γὰρ καὶ τοὺς μὴ σοφοὺς στοχάζεσθαι, τοῦ δὲ μόνον τὸν σοφόν;
that is, that the τέλος, 01 highest aim, ἐπιστήμη, 10 only such sor
the sapiens, the ὑπαιελίς 10 such for the common man. 0011111-
