BOOK Ι. ΟΗΑΡ. II, 111. 5 6, l. 181

trine it is strango that the author should not have referred to it ’

in III. 3, 14, where he discusses the same division oi duties3
second, that ξ 9 is closely connected with § '73 third, that the
whole section is a confused summary of 111.a,14 or oi De rin.
ΙΙΙ. 17, 583 and that it is absurd to suppose that Cicero would
liare written so vaguely even when most careless.

Oi course, if the section is cancelled, there is no definition of
the subjectmatter of the book, and we are tempted to assume
that something has been lost, probably aster disputatum· and
thiais one objection against cancelling it, for some definition is
necessary. Then the third book shows in many parts evidences
of the greatest haste; the author may have written the part in
question (111.a,14) without recalling what he had written in
the first book; moreover the absence of any mention in book
third might be objected as well to the delinition which is sup·
posed to have been lost aiter disputetur. Further, the beginning
of § 9, Tripleo igitar eet, ot Panaetio ardetur, sounds very much
as if Cicero had just been consulting‚ or had in mind, some other
authority for the defiuition of duty, and then with igitar, l. 22,
recurred to his especial subject, took up Panaetius again, men·
tioning him by name, and giving his threciold division. This
would explain the connection with t 7.

The passage is certainly vagae and awkward3 but there are
many carelessly written passages in the book, aud we are in-
clined to consider it genuine, with the exception, perhaps, of
Atque otiam olio diseio est officii at the beginning of § ὃς the def-
inition, however, seems to have been taken from some other an·
thor than Panaetius.

14, o. finem bonorum: See note on p. 13, 7. The first por-
tion oi ethics, Cicero says, treats of the standard of right aud
wrong, which had already been fully discussed in the Dc Finibus.
-alternm, qnod positum est ln praeceptis is the παραινετική, the
portion of ethice giving praetiosi rules of conduct. Some oi the
Stolos gave no attention to this3 Aristo even declared that it was
utterly useless, that sonnd common-sense, fortilied by knowledge
and right intentione, was sufficient. But aller the time oi Chry-
sippus the practical side was brought into greater prominence,
and was gradually developed into a system of casuistry.
