CHAP'I'EB XLIII.

1 152 67, 28. In this and the remaIning chapters of the 11101 book
Cicero treats os the condiet of two tercenta. He says 1101110
point vvas not touched upon by Panaetius; and, if vve may
judge from a remark in § 159, he made some use of Posidonius

namely, that duties flowing from iustitia take precedence' of
those from sapientia, and also of those f1·omfortitado,but not
always of those flowing from moderatio. Γ1100101001101101100 is
not very clear, and the argument is interrupted by extraneous
matter.
