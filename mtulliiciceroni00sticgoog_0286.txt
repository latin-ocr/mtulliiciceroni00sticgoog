alluded to are tho Peripateticis who considered to be toan and
utilia many things which were not necessarily locuto. ·'1'he
train of thought is naturally continued in Quod qui etc. (l. 17),
and most οἰ the commentatore consider the next sentence Quie-
qua'd . . ,sit utile as an interpolation-The expression hoco tria
genem (l. 14) is the point upon which the commentatore differ.
Heius understands itto referto: 1. The absolute tumtum, which
isat tha same time utile,· 2. The marom quod non esset utile ,·
a. The utile qaod aaa essa duratum. But thera was no previous
mention os two insuto ,· and although Cicero makes a distinc-
tion in 111. 5 17 between the cers tamtum aud that prod comma·
niter appellamus romeam, yet that distinction ia not in point
ior our passage. Other commentatore refer the trio gerrem to
the tamtum, iustum, and utile of the following sentence. But
there is really no difference between the tirst two so far as con·
cerns this passage. The two sortsofutilio are repeatedly referred
to in the third book, the real utile, and id quod utile videtum
comp. ξς 18, lo, dd.

philosophers make this distinction only as a matter of theory scr
the purpose of discussion, not meaning to recognize therehy any
substantial difference. 'versutos . . . callidos: Cicero defines
them thus: De Nat. Deor. 111. 10, 25 comtos eos appello, quoram
celeriter aum emautur ; callidos ouum, quorum tomprccm manus

cryc resumes the discussion, which was interrupted hythe digres-
sion iu regurd to the popular use of the term utile (1.8). The
utile comes to us from all external objects3 but it is only in rela-
tion to the ratane utentehus (l. 28) that we exercise any duties.
They are the Gods and men. The Gods are satisfieri bypo'atos
and canditum· and the whole subject of duty under the head'of
the utile is therefore mainly restricted to the treatment of our
fellow-men so as to make them useful to us, and to preventtheir
doing us inpune-82, 25. ea, quae gignuntur e terra: We
should say “ plants‚” but the Romans had no word exactly ccr-
responding.
